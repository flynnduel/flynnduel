# Claude Code Game Studios -- Game Studio Agent Architecture

Indie game development managed through 49 coordinated Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: None — web game (Node.js server + browser client)
- **Language**: JavaScript (Node ≥ 20, CommonJS server; plain ES modules in the browser, no build step)
- **Version Control**: Git with trunk-based development
- **Build System**: none; `npm start` runs, `npm test` (`node --test`) tests
- **Asset Pipeline**: SVG drawn in code, Web Audio synthesized sounds, bundled open-license font

> **Note**: This repo holds web party games (`src/imposter-game/`, `src/party-hub/`).
> The Godot/Unity/Unreal specialist agents do not apply; use the design, UX,
> QA, audio, narrative, production and general programming agents.
> Active work is specified in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and planned in
> `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Project Structure

@.claude/docs/directory-structure.md

## Engine Version Reference

<!-- ENGINE-REFERENCE-IMPORT: the line below is engine-specific. /setup-engine
     rewrites it to @docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md for the chosen
     engine, so a Unity or Unreal project stops loading the Godot reference every
     session. It defaults to Godot (the template's example engine); skills that
     need the pinned version read docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md on
     demand regardless of this import. -->
No engine reference is imported: this is a web project with no game engine.


## Technical Preferences

`project.yaml` at the repo root is the primary config store — engine, specialists,
naming, platform, performance, modes. Skills resolve it via `resolve_config`
(see `.claude/docs/config-resolution.md`).

`.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` is the **legacy fallback**, read on demand
when a key is absent from `project.yaml`. It is no longer imported here: before
`/setup-engine` runs it is almost entirely `[TO BE CONFIGURED]` placeholders, and
after it runs `project.yaml` holds the real values.

## Coordination Rules

@.claude/docs/coordination-rules.md

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for full protocol and examples.

> **First session?** If the project has no engine configured and no game concept,
> run `/start` to begin the guided onboarding flow.

## Coding Standards

@.claude/docs/coding-standards.md

## Context Management

Read `.claude/docs/context-management.md` on demand — it is a reference, not
session context. Two of its conventions are load-bearing and cited by name
elsewhere in the repo, so they are restated here rather than lost:

- **`production/session-state/active.md` is the session checkpoint.** The file is
  the memory, not the conversation. Read it first after any compaction, crash, or
  `/clear`.
- **Helpers in `.claude/scripts/` emit observations, never verdicts.** A script
  that scores or judges will eventually contradict a mode or override it cannot
  see. (Cited by `artifact-check.sh` and `adr-dep-graph.sh`.)
